# Modify the following file with the correct hosts.
# Ansible should detect the version of python and python binary dir on the remote hosts.
# If there will be problems, and it is not detected (e.g. python was installed to some obscure location),
# add ansible_python_interpreter=<path-to-python> variable to each host (check with the official docs in case of problems).
